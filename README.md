# BankM
Bank Managment

This code served as my intro to C++ project.
I wanted to make it to gain experience with nodes, function entanglement, and the overall language

The program is extremely buggy with limited functionality, limited to the scope of the run (If it is re run, the program wont work).
The memory ranges from permanately stored data to data that is stored when the code is run.
The issue was that I couldn't figure out how to efficiently edit the permanent data.

Another thing that was buggy was the overall organization.
I didn't coordinate my functions and think ahead of time and that caused a lot of unneccasry overlap.

Although I'm not happy with the "final product" (I might go back and edit this project), I'm happy with the lessons I have learned while doing it.
I've learned a lot about data organization as well as the need to be organized in general for larger projects.
I originially intended it to be more tree based, but that ended up only happening a little bit. But still, I got to experience how actual data structures may be implemented into code.

I'm happy with the progress and will release more functional code onto this account as I get better.

This Github will be a progression tracker for me
